# Notes App

Hey! This is a little notes app I threw together using React and Vite. It’s a straightforward tool for jotting down ideas—create a note, tweak it if you need to, or toss it when you’re done. Nothing fancy, just something that works!

## Folder Structure
Here’s how the project is laid out:

Notes-App/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Note.jsx
│   │   └── NoteList.jsx
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── index.jsx
│   └── styles/
├── public/
├── vite.config.js
├── package.json
└── README.md

## Tools Used
- **Framework**: React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Languages**: JavaScript (with JSX), CSS
- **Other**: React Hooks for state management

## Getting Started
Want to check it out locally? Here’s how to get it running:

1. Grab the code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/G-Hensley/Notes-App.git
   ```
2. Jump into the folder:
   ```bash
   cd Notes-App
   ```
3. Install what it requires:

   npm install
   ```
4. Fire it up:

5. Pop open your browser and head to http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port Vite uses).

*Edit a Note: Click a note, change what you want, and save it.
*Delete a Note: Just hit the delete button next to the note.
